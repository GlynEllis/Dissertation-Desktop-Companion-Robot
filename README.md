My dissertation that was completed in the final year of university. It is an autonomous 'robot' that is made to sit on your desk helping with productivity while also providing a friendly user experience.

It is a gui python program, all animations used were created by me. The Idea was to create a way to interact with the user without the user interacting with it directly as this would break worflow. It has to sit on your desk not interupting you but providing you with useful information to stop you straying from what you're currently supposed to be doing. It cycles weather, trello and twitter providing notification on certain changes or descriptors. The character also has many different animations, for idling or losing connection and such. This was to give a fully autonomous and robotic feel to it as if there is something living inside there. The final product was displayed on a 3.5" screen beside the laptop on a desk.

The project is currently not being worked on, but if it is revisited I would like to make it more complex and clean it up.
